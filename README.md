# Nand to Tetris - Projects 10 and 11 - Jack Compiler

This Jack Compiler, built in Python as part of [Nand to Tetris Part II, Projects 10 and 11](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2), converts Jack code (pseudo-Java) into VM bytecode. As part of a two-phase compilation process, the VM bytecode in turn is compiled into assembly using a [VM translator](https://github.com/domarp-j/n2t-vm-translator).
