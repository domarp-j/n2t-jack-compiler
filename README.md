# Nand to Tetris - Projects 10 and 11 - Jack Compiler

This VM translator, built in Python as part of [Nand to Tetris Part II, Projects 10 and 11](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2), converts Jack code (pseudo-Java) into VM bytecode.

[This VM translator](https://github.com/domarp-j/n2t-vm-translator), built earlier for projects 7 and 8, further translates VM bytecode into assembly.
